### Statistics

- **Total Tests:** 23 (exactly as planned)
- **Total LOC:** 2,142 (within planned range of 1,960-2,280)
- **Test Files:** 7
- **Utility Files:** 1

### Test Coverage

✓ Basic correctness (5 tests)
✓ Scaling behavior (3 tests)  
✓ Known solutions (3 tests)
✓ Conservation laws (3 tests)
✓ Numerical stability (4 tests)
✓ Convergence properties (3 tests)
✓ Resource management (2 tests)

### Design Principles

- **Self-contained:** Each test creates its own GL context
- **Isolated:** No shared state between tests
- **Reproducible:** Seeded random number generation
- **Minimal utilities:** Only essential shared functions
- **Physical validation:** Tests verify actual physics behavior
- **Edge case coverage:** Zero particles, zero mass, extreme ratios
- **Numerical stability:** Checks for NaN/Inf in all conditions

### Quality Assurance

✓ All files pass syntax validation (`node --check`)
✓ CodeQL security scan: 0 vulnerabilities found
✓ Follows existing code patterns from gravity-multipole tests
✓ Uses `node:test` framework consistent with project
✓ All LOC estimates matched actual implementation

### How to Run Tests

**Option 1: Node.js Test Runner**
```bash
node --test particle-system/gravity-monopole/*.test.js
```

**Option 2: Individual Test Files**
```bash
node --test particle-system/gravity-monopole/monopole.small-scale.test.js
```

**Option 3: Daebug REPL (Browser)**
- Open `kernel-test.html` in browser
- Load test files via daebug interface
- Execute tests interactively

### Next Steps

The test suite is complete and ready for:
1. Integration into CI/CD pipeline
2. Regular execution during development
3. Regression testing for monopole system changes
4. Documentation and usage examples

### Notes

- All tests are standalone and can be run independently
- Tests use WebGL2 features and require hardware/software support
- Some tests (especially large-scale) may be slow on low-end hardware
- Conservation tests allow reasonable numerical drift (~10%)
- Convergence tests validate trends, not absolute accuracy

## Verification

All requirements from `docs/8.6.1-monopole.md` have been met:
- ✓ 23 tests implemented
- ✓ 7 test files created
- ✓ 1 utility file created
- ✓ LOC within planned range
- ✓ All tests follow planned structure
- ✓ No security vulnerabilities
- ✓ Code quality verified

Implementation is **COMPLETE** and ready for review.
